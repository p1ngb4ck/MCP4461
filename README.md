Library to control MCP4461 Quad Potentiometer/Rheostat devices.
Code is still under heavy dev & provided as is, without any warranty/support (sorry).

Major code changes & updates on 2025-01-20 - library now provides all desireable functionality except HV-Commands
//ToDo: implement HV-Cmds and correct HV/A0 usage
//ToDo: "clean up" Wire object usage to allow for multiple i2c networks/busses
